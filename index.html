								<h2 class="major">About Me</h2>

								<p> I am a sign language linguist working primarily on Kata Kolok, a sign language that emerged spontaneously in a village community in Bali. In my research, I am interested in the intersection of language acquisition, sociolinguistics and language and interaction with a focus on signed languages. I am curious about how languages emerge and adapt within their ecological niches and how language is shaped by and for social interaction.
								<p> Before I started my Marie Curie project LETITIA, I have been a postdoc at the ERC-funded <a href="https://www.signmorph.net/"> SignMorph Project </a> at University of Birmingham, headed by <a href="https://sites.google.com/view/adamcschembri/home"> Adam Schembri </a> and at the ERC-funded <a href="https://elisa.tshdresearch.org/projects/"> Emergence of Language in Social Interaction (ELISA) Project </a> at Tilburg University, headed by <a href="https://www.tilburguniversity.edu/staff/connie-devos40"> Connie de Vos </a> .
								<p> I obtained my Bachelor degree in "Sign Languages" from Hamburg University in 2014, my research Master degree in "Linguistics", specialised in Sign Language Linguistics, from University of Amsterdam in 2017, and my PhD from Radboud University Nijmegen in March 2022.

								<h2 class="major">Research</h2>
								<p> Most of my research focuses on Kata Kolok, a sign language used in a rural enclave in Bali, Indonesia.
									My work so far has been a combination of language documentation, research into different aspects of variation on several levels of linguistic description and research into language acquisition. I have also worked on conversational data, applying methods from Conversation Analysis. <p>

								<h3 class="minor"> Pragmatics </h3>
								<span class="image main"><img src="images/project_pragmatics.jpg" alt="" /></span>
								<p> I have worked on repair and continuers (a type of feedback) in BSL signers and English speakers with <a href=""> Lierin de Wael </a>, <a href=""> Rehana Omardeen and <a href="https://markdingemanse.net/"> Mark Dingemanse </a>. We find that signers and speakers use lots and lots of non-manual elements to indicate understanding or misunderstanding in conversation - and that these elements largely align in terms of form across English and BSL!
								<br> In October, I started working on the acquisition of turn-taking in Kata Kolok (within my Marie Curie LETITIA project). I will be looking at question-answer sequences and investigate structure (and hopefully timing) in adult Kata Kolok signers and deaf child signers using data from the Kata Kolok Child Signing Corpus! I am particularly interested in conversational settings - who signs to whom and how many people are present?
									<em>
								<p> Ongoing variation work:
												<br> 1) I am working with <a href="https://www.su.se/profiles/jmesc-1.182477"> Johanna Mesch </a> on the LETITIA project. First on adults, then on children!
												<br> 2) With <a href="https://www.laurenwreed.com/"> Lauren Reed </a> and <a href=""> Josefina Safar </a>, I am exploring response tokens ( a type of feedback) in five different signing communities!
											</em>
								<br>
								<br>

								<h3 class="minor"> Variation </h3>
								<span class="image main"><img src="images/project_variation.jpeg" alt="" /></span>
								<p>I have explored variation in the form of signs and in the lexicon. In co-authored work with <a href=" https://orcid.org/0000-0001-7680-6834"> Katie Mudd </a>, we have found that whether Kata Kolok signers are hearing or deaf influences their choice of signs in a picture elicitation task. We used a lexical distance measure to analyse people's responses. Building up on this work, we have made a cross-linguistic comparison, comparing our data from Kata Kolok and data from British Sign Language and Israeli Sign Language. We show that the language-level variation in all three languages is similar but highest in BSL but that BSL variation shows the higest level of grouping. This is particularly exciting because the literature suggests that smaller sign languages, like Kata Kolok, show more lexical variation than bigger sign languages. We also looked into lexical variation among Balinese Homesigners within the ELISA project, and found that social interaction correlates with lexical variation!
								<em>
									<p> Ongoing variation work:
											<br> 1) I am working with <a href="https://www.uclan.ac.uk/academics/nick-palfreyman"> Nick Palfreyman </a> and the Indonesian team from his ELDP project on comparing the same lexical picture stimuli we used in Kata Kolok and Balinese Homesigners to deaf signers from other places across Indonesia!
										</em>
								<br>
								<br>

								<h3 class="minor"> Acquisition of Kata Kolok </h3>
								<span class="image main"><img src="images/project_acquisition.JPG" alt="" /></span>
								<p>Some of my favourite projects are focused on how deaf children acquire Kata Kolok - I have used observational and experimental data. In a study based on naturalistic data, I have analysed many hours of longitudinal recordings of four deaf children for child modifications of signs, i.e. signs that deviate from the adult target. The focus children grow up with many of their immediate family members being deaf, but also many hearing relatives who can sign. I analysed these signs using a feature-coding used for adult signers as well. I found that the data includes most modifications in handshape but that location features are often changed as well. I have also designed and conducted a low-tech version of an familiarisation paradigm with signing and non-signing children in the community. In this study, I have animated a monkey to sign Kata Kolok sign and we recorded signing children (hearing and deaf) and non-signing children while watching the monkey sign correct Kata Kolok signs or mispronounced Kata Kolok signs. I found that the traditional analyses do not reveal any group differences but additional behavioural analyses may point to differences between groups. This project is crucial to kickstarting experimental acquisition work in the field - an endeavour that is not often done due to the many challenges met. </br >
								<em>
									<p> Ongoing acquisition work:
										<br> 1) Turn-taking within the LETITIA project!
										<br> 2) I have been doing some pilot coding on child-directed signing and input in Kata Kolok. Very slow but very exciting!
								</em>
									<br>
								<br>

								<h3 class="minor"> Morphological complexity </h3>
								<p> We are discussing the parallels and flawed comparisons between sign languages and creoles in an exciting paper with <a href=""> Felicia Bisnath </a>, <a href=""> Marah Jaraisy </a>, <a href=""> Rehana Omardeen </a> and <a href=""> Adam Schembri </a>
								<br>
								<br>

								<h3 class="minor"> Iconicity </h3>
								<span class="image main"><img src="images/project_iconicity copy.jpg" alt="" /></span>
								<p> Can non-signers understand the iconicity in BSL morphology? We are investigating this question with a series of experiments within the <a href="https://www.signmorph.net/"> SignMorph team </a>.
								<br>
								<br>


								<h3 class="minor"> Negation in Kata Kolok </h3>
								<span class="image main"><img src="images/project_negation.jpg" alt="" /></span>
								<p>For my MA thesis, I studied how negation is expressed in Kata Kolok, using spontaneous data from the Kata Kolok Corpus. I investigated spontaneous dyadic conversations of six deaf Kata Kolok signers from three subsequent generations as to the form of the negator they use and the position of the negator. My data suggests that, against what has been previously reported, Kata Kolok signers use a manual sign and a negative side-to-side headshake to negate propositions. Both markers probably have a origin in co-speech gesture. Non-existentials are marked with tongue protrusion, which is not found in co-speech gesture, but maybe there is a link to the daemon Rangda from Balinese mythology.  </br >
								<em>
									<p> Ongoing negation work:
									<br> 1) Together with my PhD student <a href="https://www.tilburguniversity.edu/staff/s-prasodjo"> Satyawati </a>, we are currently looking into conversational data from seven Balinese homesigners to explore their negation pattern!
									<br> 2) I am also involved in a big comparative study of negative headshake led by <a href="https://vadimkimmelman.com/"> Vadim Kimmelman </a>. Stay tuned for updates!
								</em>
									<br>
								<br>

								<h3 class="minor"> Name signs in Kata Kolok and Sign Language of the Netherlands </h3>
								<span class="image main"><img src="images/project_namesign.jpeg" alt="" /></span>
								<p> In this project, I looked at the form of name signs, i.e. signs attributed to people, in Kata Kolok and Sign Language of the Netherlands.<p>
								 <p> Name signs in Kata Kolok are descriptive. In NGT, they may incorporate fingerspelling. In both languages, name signs tend to be one-handed and located around the head. Only KK name signs comprise many basic handshapes and often make contact with the body. Very different is what the mouth does: in NGT, signers always imitate the spoken name; in Kata Kolok, signers never imitate the name but often use nonmanuals. My favourite finding is that Kata Kolok has nonmanual name signs! </p>

										<p> I am a also a yoga teacher - I hold a certificate as Ashtanga Yoga teacher and as Pre- and Post-natal Yoga Teacher. I am really excited about sharing the time and the practice with others and love seeing them enjoy their time on their mat! I'd describe my style as energetic and dynamic but not too intense.
										<span class="image main"><img src="images/IMG_4225.jpg" alt="" /></span>
										<br>
										<h3 class="minor"> Ashtanga </h3>
										<p>In 2019, I completed a Yoga Teacher Training (200hrs) with Annemieke van der Zouwen, Joeri Roelandt, and Helena Peirtsegaele at <a href="https://www.ashtanga-academy.nl/index.html">Ashtanga Yoga Academy</a>. Ashtanga is a dymanic form of yoga and the practice is designed around several series of Asanas. Ever since I got my certification, I have been teaching a weekly mixed levels Ashtanga-inspired class online.
										<br> The class currently takes place on Sunday evening, 19:30-20:30 CET. Get in touch if you are interested in joining! </p>
										<br>
										<h3 class="minor"> Pre- and post-natal Yoga </h3>
										<p>In 2021, I completed a training to certify as AYA pre- and post-natal yoga teacher (100hrs) at <a href="https://www.unit-yoga.de/">Unit</a>. Shortly after, I got pregnant myself and used all knowledge during my own pregnancy, birth and postnatal practice. I have also taught some individual classes.
